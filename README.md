# HAND DETECTION USING MEDIAPIPE

# PROJECT OVERVIEW
- This project demonstrates real-time hand detection using the Mediapipe library in Python. The goal is to utilize the webcam to detect and visualize hand landmarks and connections in a live video feed. Mediapipe's powerful hand detection model is leveraged to track hand movements and draw landmarks on the detected hands.
